Testing different speed of sorting using processes on various amount of files. There are 4 other files in the directory, but none of those are CSV so it should have a negligible impact on time. The csv files that are being sorted each have 300 lines of data in them, plus one line dedicated to the categories, so 301 lines in total. 

Executed by using the linux command:

(time ./sorter -c color -d /ilab/users/jjr263/FALL17/CS214/project2analysis -o /ilab/users/jjr263/FALL17/CS214/project2analysis) 2>> threadsTrialsInfo.txt
